		<h4>About</h4>
		<p>Link is a high-level programming language with low-level programming features. It uses a JSON-based syntax to quickly
			parse a program and run it. Due to its JSON-based syntax, Link can be run on any platform with many different programming
			language bases from NodeJS to JavaScript and HTML, as well as Python in the future. Link also has the ability to be compiled
			from other programming languages, whether text-based or block-based. Link is also perfect for compiling block-based programs
			such as those you can find on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, among other websites. Learning the Link programming
			language also takes Computer Science to a new level by how the Link compiler uses the same processes as used in low-level
			programming languages including Assembly. Like low-level programming languages, Link uses step-by-step instructions to
			run a program. However, unlike most low-level languages, Link also supports recursion and the base for Link is entirely
			object-oriented and you can add new functions to the language using the host language (currently only JavaScript since
			Link for Python has not been created yet). While Link may use a lot of memory to store its programs due to its JSON-based
			syntax, Link helps you visualize how your program will run and requires no knowledge of other programming languages to
			use. Additionally, you cannot have syntax errors in Link unless you forget the name of one of your Link Blocks (single
			commands as used in Link). However, you must be aware of the usages of various functions in Link or you may end up triggering
			an error in the host language.</p>

		<h4>How It Works</h4>
		<p>Link starts out with its JSON-based code which the programmer writes to then run a certain program. When you compile
			the Link program, the language will sort through the array of Link Blocks to then create an object (JavaScript)/dictionary
			(Python) form of the array-based Link Block syntax. Then, when starting the program, the first Link Block to run is the
			one named "start". When it starts, the code reader will redirect to other Link Blocks as they are referenced in the parameter
			inputs and sequencing attributes in each Link Block. The Link syntax is essentially a text-based version of a flowchart.
			Therefore, a future IDE could simply be a flowchart creator that compiles into Link.</p>

		<h4>What It Can Do</h4>
		<p>Link can actually do anything its host langauge can do. Since Link's base is object-oriented, you can use the Link language
			to add new functions for Link Blocks that are written in the host language. Many of the host language functions are already
			in the modules for a specific version of Link (Link for Web, Link for NodeJS, Link for Python, etc.), but any host language
			functions not included can be added through your own module or a "def" function in a Link Block in your main code. However,
			Link can't only do what the host language can. Link also has a built-in secure memory system that cannot be hacked (at
			least that I know of).</p>
